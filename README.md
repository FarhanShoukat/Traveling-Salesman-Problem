# Traveling-Salesman-Problem

## Abstract:
In this project, three methods were used to classify digits 1, 3, 4 and 8. The classification is done using kNN, Decision Tree and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). First, image data is either normalized or scaled. Then it is fed to classifier.

## Methadology:
First, training images (pixel values) and their labels are read. Then, classifier is trained using training data and labels. Finally, test data is used to evaluate training.

### 1) Data Set Selection:
Dataset used here is a subset of MNIST data set which include images of 0-9 digits. In this project, only 1, 3, 4 and 8 were used for digit recognition. This dataset's main purpose is to compare different approaches of image classification. The code can be run on any dataset.

### 2) Feature Selection:
It was found that many of the starting and ending bits of a number are zero. So, those bits were removed. It helped decrease feature length. It reduced prediction time for kNN by 10-15%.

### 3) Data Pre-processing:
After reading data and removing features in feature selection, data was preprocessed. In this case, normalization and scaling were tested.

### 4) Machine Learning Algorithm:
As I am using supervised learning approach to classify, I used kNN, Decision Tree and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).


## Results:
I got good results from all the methods. Both kNN and CNN gave best results. Moreover, Decision Tree and CNN were better performance wise.
Detailed results are given in Reports folder.


## Conclusion:
To conclude, all methods work for image classification. However, CNN gives great results with minimum prediction time.
